# SQL-Data-Analysis-Online-Bookstore

This project involved building a structured relational database to store and analyze book sales, customer data, and order transactions. Using PostgreSQL, I performed various SQL operations, including:
✅ Data Import & Cleaning – Processed raw CSV files for structured storage.
✅ Basic Queries – Filtering books by genre, listing customers by location, and tracking orders over time.
✅ Advanced Analysis – Finding best-selling books, revenue calculations, customer purchase patterns, and stock tracking.
✅ Performance Optimization – Using indexes, joins, and aggregate functions to optimize query performance.
